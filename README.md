# Customer-Shopping-Trends-Analysis

Customer Shopping Trends Analysis
This repository presents a data analysis and visualization project focused on understanding shopping behavior from customer data. Using Python and essential data libraries, we dive into trends related to visits, spending patterns, demographics, and product preferences.

📁 Dataset
The dataset used is a simulated Customer Shopping Trends dataset that includes features like:

Customer ID

Gender

Age

Category (product)

Purchase Amount (USD)

Optionally, a simulated VisitDate

The dataset can be modified or extended to match real-world customer transaction records for deeper insights.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python 3

pandas – data manipulation

matplotlib – visualizations

numpy – randomization for date simulation
